Since [Amazon Photos](https://www.amazon.com/photos) is still a thing (and might not be abandonware), perhaps it'd make the most sense to shove the stuff there -- that's not as nice as having them all available from Google Photos, but at least they'll be easily viewable.

However, naturally, the API for using it seems complex.

Those instructions assume that I'm writing an Android or iOS app, which I most certainly am not.
